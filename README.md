# Our Mission at GNKS.Games: 
GNKS Games aims to bridge the gap between education and enthusiasm. The primary purpose of any educational institution should be to instill a sense of 
eagerness to learn more. Through its vast assortment of interactive games for Punjabi-language Practice, GNKS Games serves to reinforce linguistic-learning 
in an engaging manner —— fulfilling this very purpose! Ultimately: How can one be eager to learn, if they don't enjoy doing so?
